    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe is a variation on traditional chicken piquant, which is spicy
      Cajun chicken. This comes together quickly and is good served over white
      rice.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's)</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>
        1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as
        RO*TEL)
      </li>
      <li>1/4 cup diced sweet pickles</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons drained capers</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix flour and Creole seasoning together in a shallow bowl. Dredge
        chicken through flour mixture, shaking of excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium-heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until
        browned, about 2 minutes per side. Add diced tomatoes with green chile
        peppers, pickles, vinegar, capers, and garlic; simmer until chicken is
        no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C).
